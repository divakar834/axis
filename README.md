# AXIS — Automated eXamination & Investigation System

> A fully offline, local AI-powered cybercrime investigation platform for law enforcement and forensic analysts.

---

## What is AXIS?

AXIS is a forensic investigation tool that lets you upload raw digital evidence — chat transcripts, emails, images, PDFs, network logs, CSVs — and automatically:

- Extracts entities (names, phones, IPs, URLs, amounts, UPI IDs, crypto wallets, and more)
- Identifies the crime type and assesses threat level
- Generates a structured executive summary with key findings
- Recommends investigative actions and applicable Indian law sections
- Exports a professional multi-page forensic PDF report

**Everything runs locally. Zero data leaves the device. No internet required.**

## Features

- Multi-file evidence upload (drag & drop)
- Supports `.txt`, `.csv`, `.log`, `.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`
- Image OCR via LLaVA 7B (reads text from WhatsApp screenshots, CCTV stills, scanned documents)
- PDF parsing via `pdf-parse`
- Custom regex + confidence-scored NLP entity parser
- AI analysis via Llama 3.1 8B (runs fully offline via Ollama)
- Multi-page PDF export with full entity table

## Installation & Setup

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/divakar834/axis.git
cd axis
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

**3. Pull the required AI models**
```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
ollama pull llava:7b
```
> Note: `llama3.1:8b` is ~4.9GB and `llava:7b` is ~4.7GB. Requires ~10GB free disk space.

**4. Start Ollama** (keep this running in the background)
```bash
ollama serve
```
> If you see `bind: Only one usage of each socket address` — Ollama is already running. Skip this step.

**5. Run AXIS**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**6. Open in browser**
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Crime Types Detected

Cyber Fraud · Phishing · Identity Theft · Unauthorized Hacking · Data Exfiltration · Credential Theft · Money Laundering · Blackmail · Ransomware Attack · Extortion · Impersonation · Online Harassment · Financial Fraud · Corporate Espionage · Stalking · Forgery · Trafficking · and more

## System Requirements

| Component | Minimum |
|---|---|
| RAM | 8GB (16GB recommended) |
| Disk | 15GB free |
| OS | Windows 10+, macOS 12+, Ubuntu 20.04+ |
| GPU | Not required (CPU inference) |

> First model load takes 1–2 minutes. Subsequent calls are faster as Ollama keeps models cached in memory.

## Dataset

The evidence samples used for development and testing were created as a custom synthetic dataset simulating real Indian cybercrime cases — including UPI fraud, SBI phishing, QR code swap attacks, credential theft, and data exfiltration. All data was manually crafted to reflect Indian-specific patterns (UPI IDs, Indian phone numbers, rupee amounts, Indian cities and localities, IT Act and IPC references).

---

## Legal

This tool is intended for use by law enforcement, forensic analysts, and cybersecurity researchers. All analysis runs locally on the user's device. No data is transmitted externally.
